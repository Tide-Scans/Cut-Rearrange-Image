# Cut-Rearrange-Image

Cut-Rearrange-Image is a Python script that takes an image, divides it into 16 squares/rectangles, and rearranges them in a specific pattern to create a new image.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Pillow library installed (can be installed using `pip install Pillow`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script `image_rearrange_batch.py` to your computer.

2. Create two folders in the same directory as the script:
   - `input_images`: Place your input images here.
   - `output_images`: The rearranged images will be saved in this folder.

3. Place the image(s) you want to manipulate in the `input_images` folder.

4. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script.

5. Run the script using the following command:

6. The script will process each image from the `input_images` folder, rearrange the pieces, and save the resulting images with "_rearranged" appended to the filenames in the `output_images` folder.

7. Once the script has finished running, you will find the rearranged images in the `output_images` folder.

## Customization

- You can modify the rearrangement pattern by editing the `rearranged_pieces` list in the script.
- Ensure that the input and output folder names match your setup.

## Notes

- Always back up your original images before running the script, as it will modify the images in the `input_images` folder.
